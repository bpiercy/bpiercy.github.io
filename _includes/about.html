                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD student studying atomic layer deposition at the Georgia Institute of Technology working with Dr. Mark Losego. I am interested in developing multifunctional nanoscale coatings to improve energy generation, solar fuel production, and photo or electrochemically activated catalysis.</p>
                <p>Prior to starting my PhD, I worked for two years at De Nora Tech, a world leader in chlor-alkali electrochemistry.</p>
                <p>I obtained my B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. I believe that the study of materials is the key step in develop world changing technologies of the future.</p>
